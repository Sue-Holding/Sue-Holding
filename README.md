## Hi there, my name's Sue!👋

I'm a **Full Stack Open Source developer** in training at **Chas Academy** in Stockholm. 
I am currently looking for a LIA placement between **3rd November 2025 to 5th April 2026** to focus putting my new skills into practice in the work place.

In my free time after coding, I'm a mum of an almost 3-year-old, which keeps me on my toes and makes life extra fun 🥰
