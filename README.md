## Hi there, my name's Sue!👋

I'm a Full Stack Open Source developer in training at Chas Academy in Stockholm. 
I am currently looking for a LIA placement between 3rd November 2025 to 5th April 2026 to focus putting my new skills into practice in the work place.

In my free time after coding I'm a mum of an almost 3 year old which is a lot of fun 🥰
